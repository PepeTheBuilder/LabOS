LabOS_2023

Made by Paul Petrut 

This are my three projects made in the second year for the operating system labs. My work is the files name something like: aX.c where X is one of these x={1,2,3}. Whast the program shall do it is in the aX.pdf

The project were made in C and on Linux, probably they don't work on windows because of the special function calls. The grade was given by a tester foe each.

The third one i dind't do it just because it will be just 0.1p/10 in the final grade for an 8 and 0.2p/10 for a 10 grade and i din't had enough time for the other projects.

P.S. i need to take at least 1p/100 for it so i can pass the exam because the avrage must be >=5 and any grade >0.
