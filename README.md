LabOS_2023
Made by Paul Petrut 
This are my three projects made in the second year for the operating system labs 
The third one i dind't do it just because it will be just 0.1p/10 in the final grade for an 8 and 0.2p/10 for a 10 grade and i din't had enough time for the other projects
P.S. i need to take at least 1p/100 for it so i can pass the exam because the avrage must be >=5 and any grade >0
