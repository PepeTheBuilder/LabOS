LabOS_2023

Made by Paul Petrut 

This are my three projects made in the second year for the operating system labs. My work is the files name something like: aX.c where X is one of these x={1,2,3}. Whast the program shall do it is in the aX.pdf

The project were made in C and on Linux, probably i will not work on Windows because of the special function calls.

The first one involves tasks related to manipulating files, organizing them into folders or directories, and analyzing the content of files for specific information.

Project A2 centers around understanding and implementing processes, threads, and synchronization techniques to manage concurrent execution within a system.

Project A3 emphasizes the use of pipes for inter-process communication, allowing data to flow between different processes in a controlled manner.
